## CAEH - CERTIFIED ADVANCED ETHICAL HACKERS
### Course Overview
##### Certified Advanced Ethical Hackers (CAEH) is a certification program for an information security professional, also referred to as a white-hat hacker, who systematically attempts to inspect network infrastructure with the consent of its owner to find security vulnerabilities which a malicious hacker could potentially exploit. The program helps you assess the security posture of an organization by identifying vulnerabilities in the network and system infrastructure to determine if unauthorized access is possible. The Certified Ethical Hacker program is the most comprehensive Ethical Hacking program in the world. It is the first of three programs within our Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) track. This program will upskill you on the most advanced tools and techniques used by black and grey hat hackers alike to break into an organization to assess, document, and remediate vulnerabilities from a vendor neutral perspective. CAEH will put you in the driver&rsquo;s seat of an interactive, hand&rsquo;s-on learning environment that challenges you to test the integrity of systems and networks by hacking them!

##### CAEH v1 training program includes 20 modules covering various technologies, tactics, and procedures, providing prospective ethical hackers with the core knowledge needed to thrive in cybersecurity. Delivered through a carefully curated training plan that typically spans five days, the 12th version of the CAEH continues to evolve to keep up with the latest OS, exploits, tools, and techniques. The concepts covered in the training program are split 50/50 between knowledge-based training and hands-on application through our cyber range.Every tactic discussed in training is backed by step-by-step labs conducted in a virtualized environment with live targets, live tools, and vulnerable systems. Through our lab technology, every participant will have comprehensive hands-on practice to learn and apply their knowledge.”
